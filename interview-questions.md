# ASSESSMENT 2: Interview Practice Questions

Answer the following questions.

First, without external resources. Challenge yourself to answer from memory as if you were in a job interview.

Then, research the question to expand on your answer. Even if you feel you have answered the question completely, there is always something more to learn. Write your researched answer in your OWN WORDS.

1. What is iteration?

  Your answer: This word describes how many times something does Something a good example of this is how many times The wheels on a car rotate. 
  Whenever I hear the word iteration I always think of being in the Army and how many push-ups we are about to do, so this word really does not have any pleasant memories for me.

  Researched answer: the research that I've done and it's a ration is the term used for the process of performing a particular action a certain number of times and 
  in terms of a function or a loop that have Conditions in them. The iteration will not stop until those conditions are met. As an example if you were trying to get the number 15 reduced down to zero. 
  You function would have to perform 3 to 4 iterations to do so.



2. The built in method .map() takes predefined parameters. What are they? Which are required and which are optional?

  Your answer: I know that in order to use the .map() Method you need to have an old array that you want to convert into a new array. A good example of this is, 
  If you had an array of 1, 2, 3 and you wanted them to double. You could create a loop for it and have 5 to 6 lines of code or you could use the .map() and simplify that down to 1 to 2 lines of code

  Researched answer: According to my research and what the syllabus says, Is that a function iterate through an array and returns a new array at the same length meaning that if you put in five numbers it's going to give you five numbers back. 
  Now that I've done the research and looked through my answer versus my research answer I have noticed that I did not include that it will bring back the same length of array. 
  So I put that in my notes because I think that it is important to remember that because that is one of the things that separates.Mac from other functions/higher order functions.



3. What is object destructuring?

  Your answer: Distracting to me is the ability to take something and break it down into a more simpler form that is easier to work with. In the army I would use this term whenever we went to the field and they gave me an MRE (Meal ready to eat).
  As a whole it is bulky and takes up precious space in your rucksack but if you upacked it. You could then place the smaller packages wherever you wanted to.

  Researched answer: The definition They are really just a special way of assigning variables in Java script and it allows a race or an object to unpack their values into individual variables. Sounds like I was on the right track with thinking that it broke it down into smaller pieces.
  As we saw in class objects in a race can get pretty freaking big real quick and so it is important that we understand how to break them down into a more manageable size.
  I mean if you want like a real life example of it it's like a house you never see him shipping a full house. 
  It always comes in smaller pieces and then gets re-put back together to make the whole house.



4. What is the difference between an object and a class?

  Your answer: Objects Have key values while classes are the blueprints For those objects. When I hear the word blueprint I think of my days back in high school when I took a drafting class. Blue prints are a technical drawing and shows you the layout of whatever you're trying to build. So when we were in class and we first started studying classes. My mind went immediately to the fact that that means that we are building a layout of which objects go in.

  Researched answer: So in my research they use the word that I liked which was template. A template is a visual representation of how the objects get put together in order to complete your project. Which means that the answer that I gave above was on par with what the differences between an object in the class are. Are some good examples of this are things like Vehicles being a class and then a sub class would be car truck or SUV and so forth.



5. Why would you use the method super()?

  Your answer: As we talked before we have objects listed in a class and then we have Sub classes and in order to have those sub classes inherit the traits of it's parent class we use super to extend those traits to the sub classes. In my mind this method is what really makes a parent and child function work together. See computers are not that intelligent they only receive and translate data that we tell them to so instead of having to retype everything out twice why not have a built-in method that simplifies that down to one word that is where super() comes into play.

  Researched answer: So I was thinking on the right line, super() deals with inheritance And inheritance is what happens when you have a parent function or object and it passes that information down to its child. Truth be told I love technology of parent versus child because it is self-explanatory in what is happening to your data. Even a five-year-old can understand the concept of inheritance when you use the terms parent and child. I just wish that all of the definitions and concepts were this easy for me to grasp.



6. STRETCH: What is hoisting in JavaScript?

  Your answer: To be honest I am not entirely sure I think it is a default mode for JavaScript. So if you well give me some time I can definitely look that up and find the correct answer for you.

  Researched answer: OK so I was sort of right hosting Is JavaScript default behavior of moving declarations to the top. What that means is that you can use a variable before it has been declared and vice versa but JavaScript will always recognize it as being declared first. And example of this is var = x on one line and X = 5 on another line somewhere in your code.



## Looking Ahead: Terms for Next Week

Research and define the following terms to the best of your ability.

1. React: This is a program that is a library for Java script to help build user interfaces

2. React lifecycle methods: there are three phases in it mounting, updating and unmouting.

3. React state: this is a built-in component of react it stores property values that belongs to the component.

4. Component invocation/call: tis is how You call or invoke a component within react. Components are a lot like functions.

5. DOM Events: Allows JavaScript JavaScript to group functions together and those functions will not be executed and human event is executed
